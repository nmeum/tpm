=head1 NAME

tpm - tiny password manager

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<tpm> I<COMMAND> I<ENTRY>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

tpm is a tiny shell script which is heavily inspired and largely
compatible with pass(1). Just like pass it uses gpg2(1) to securely
store your passwords, the major difference between pass and tpm is that
the latter is a lot more minimal.

Invoking tpm consists of specifying a command either I<insert> or
I<show> and supplying one entry as a target. If I<insert> is specified
as a command tpm will create a new entry and prompt for the
corresponding password. If you specify I<show> as a command tpm will
display the password for the given entry.

The convenience methods I<new> and I<clipboard> will create and register
a new password or copy an entry to the X11 clipboard, respectively and
I<remove> and I<update> can be used to delete or update existing entries.
